"""The Roman liturgical calendar, computed locally.

Easter is a closed-form calculation, every movable season follows from Easter,
and the ferial lectionary numbers are arithmetic on the season and weekday. So
the lectionary number for a date needs no network, and unlike a scraped answer
it can be checked against homilies whose numbers are already known.

    lectionary_number(date)          -> the number for that day, or None
    describe(date)                   -> "Thu 24th of OT", "Ash Wednesday", ...
    ferial_year(date)                -> "I" or "II", for Ordinary Time weekdays
    cycle(date)                      -> "A", "B" or "C", for Sundays
    dates_for_lectionary(n, around)  -> candidate dates, nearest first

What it covers: the temporal cycle (Advent, Christmas, Lent, Holy Week, Easter,
Ordinary Time), ferial and Sunday, plus the fixed solemnities and feasts that
come up most. It does not know the whole sanctoral calendar; an unknown day
returns None rather than a guess. Stdlib only.
