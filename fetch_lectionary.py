Source: the tables Felix Just SJ publishes at catholic-resources.org, which are
keyed by lectionary number. Fourteen pages cover the whole cycle, fetched 1.5 s
apart, so the request count is bounded by the source's size -- fourteen, ever --
rather than one per homily, which is what USCCB objects to.

Pages are cached as HTML and the parsed table as JSON, both under tmp/ in the
preaching directory and neither committed: this is someone else's compilation,
fetched on demand rather than redistributed.
